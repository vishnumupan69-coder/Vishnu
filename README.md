# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes, and you may see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for performance.  
The build is minified and filenames include hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section for more information.

### `npm run eject`
**Note:** this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!  
It removes the single build dependency and copies all config files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) so you can edit them manually.
